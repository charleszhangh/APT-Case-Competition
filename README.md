# APT_Case_competition
Code used for the APT Data Analytics Case Competition.
My team was given two datasets from 400 stores of a grocery chain. 
- The first dataset, "storemaster," had various fields of the stores like location, open time, close time, number of employees, cost of employees, cost of utilities, etc. 
- The second dataset, "financials," held the financial performance of every store during a certain timeframe.

Our goal was to find optimal open and closing times and number of employees for all 400 stores based on the given data.

apt_model created organized the data and created a multiple regression model with the various factors. apt_predict gave the optimized operations recommendations for each store.

Our team won 1st place at the APT Data Analytics Consulting Case Competition after presenting our findings to experts from APT.
